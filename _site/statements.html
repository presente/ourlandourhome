                <h4>Statement by Arturo Carmona, Executive Director of Presente.org: </h4>
                <p>“We are thrilled by the data in this poll, which finds overwhelming support for key arguments in the environmental justice fight and validates strong Latino commitment to fighting climate change.  Latino voters are sending a powerful message that we see a bright future without petroleum, with less pollution, where most resources and pollution reduction mandates benefit the most impacted communities in the state.  Our community is demanding a healthier, greener, a more just, and more equitable environmental transformation of our economy and society.  But the poll also sends a chilling message of accountability to those elected officials still willing to advance the lies of Big Oil and their allies saying ‘we don’t support you and you do not speak for us’.”</p>
                <h4>Statement by Byron Gudiel, Executive Director of Communities for a Better Environment: </h4>
                <p>“Community and individual health is threatened by poor air quality, the drought, wildfires, and extreme heat. Our use of fossil fuel comes with a steep price tag for asthma, cancer, low birth weight, and all chronic illnesses linked to poor air quality and climate change. <br/><br/>Latinos want and expect strong climate policies that address air pollution, promote clean energy production and promote real economic opportunities. We know Latino health is threatened by the drought, extreme heat and other weather events. Additionally, climate change will make our current air pollution problem worse, as days get hotter we will see more ground-level ozone. With fires we will see increased particulate matter and with that will come more emergency room visits, hospitalizations and acute asthma attacks. As this poll suggests, addressing climate change is a public health imperative that Latinos understand and take seriously. Reducing health disparities and protecting the health of future generations is a major priority for Latinos who are calling for a rapid transition to a just and healthy economy by investing in clean energy solutions.”</p>
                <h4>Statement by Martha Arguello, Executive Director of Physicians for Social Responsibility - Los Angeles:</h4> 
                <p>“Community and individual health is threatened by poor air quality, the drought, wildfires, and extreme heat. Our use of fossil fuel comes with a steep price tag for asthma, cancer, low birth weight, and all chronic illnesses linked to poor air quality and climate change. <br/><br/>
                Latinos want and expect strong climate policies that address air pollution, promote clean energy production and promote real economic opportunities. We know Latino health is threatened by the drought, extreme heat and other weather events. Additionally, climate change will make our current air pollution problem worse, as days get hotter we will see more ground-level ozone.

                <h4>Statement by Strela Cervas, Co-Director of the California Environmental Justice Alliance: </h4>
                <p>“California's new majority wants clean, equitable energy.  Latino and other communities of color have been on the frontlines of fossil fuel pollution for decades and now our neighborhoods are among the most vulnerable to climate disruption and extreme weather. That’s why we need to be on the frontlines of the solution: clean, renewable, local energy.<br/><br/>

                This poll clearly demonstrates that Latinos see the need for renewable energy to combat climate change. Latinos want to see the economic benefits as well – living wage, sustainable and healthy jobs – and they want to see renewable energy investments and infrastructure spread equitably across all California communities.</br><br/>
                It’s time to ensure that low-income communities of color no longer bear the disproportionate impacts of energy pollution. As California creates our “next generation” of climate policies, we have the opportunity to build an even stronger renewable energy system that invests in the communities who need it the most. Equitable renewable energy can provide some of California’s most over-polluted communities with a clean, healthy environment and create living wage economic opportunities.”</p>

                <h4>Statement by Alvaro Sanchez, Environmental Equity Director at the Greenlining Institute: </h4>
                <p>"California Latinos understand how clean energy investments can bring both jobs and cleaner air to Latino communities -- communities that now breathe some of the dirtiest air in the country. We've made a promising start, charging polluters and putting those dollars into clean transportation, energy efficiency and solar power for low-income communities, and Latinos want to see those investments grow. Every community needs a piece of the clean energy future."</p>
